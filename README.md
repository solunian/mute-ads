# Mute Ads On Spotify
A straightforward python project to mute ads on Spotify through system audio. Follows OAuth2 authorization flow.

### Description
To all those who would rather not pay for Spotify Premium, this application is meant to mute those disruptive ads through the system volume. Thanks to the gracious people building the Spotify API, the volume setting is only for Premium users, and that would negate the purpose of this project. Support for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. A work in progress.

# Dev Notes
Ha..haha... whoops don't put client_secret out in a public repo on Github. It's still in the old commit history though... so generate a new one!
