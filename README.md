# Mute Ads On Spotify
A straightforward python project to mute ads on Spotify. Follows OAuth2 authorization flow.
### Description
To all those who would rather not pay for Spotify Premium, this application is meant to mute those disruptive ads through the system volume. Thanks to the friends building the Spotify API, the volume setting on the app is only for Premium users, and that would negate the purpose of this project. Support only for Windows (currently). A work in progress.
